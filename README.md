# Portfolio_Personal
# 👋 Hi, and thanks for checking out my project!

Before you get started, please follow these simple steps:

1. 🌐 **Make sure you are connected to the internet.**  
   This project uses external resources like Google Fonts, CDN libraries, and form services that require an active internet connection.

2. 📁 **Open the folder named "Open First".**  
   Inside, you’ll find a file named "1_Run_first.html" — open this file in your browser to launch the portfolio.

That’s it! Enjoy exploring the portfolio.  
Feel free to customize and build upon it!
